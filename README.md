Predicting Term Deposit Subscriptions
# Predicting Term Deposit Subscriptions

## Project Overview
This project is aimed at solving a classification problem for a retail banking institution. The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on their personal, financial, and telemarketing interaction data. By accurately identifying potential subscribers, the bank can optimize its telemarketing campaigns, reduce costs, and improve the efficiency of outreach efforts.

## Problem Statement
Term deposits are a major income source for banks, and telemarketing remains one of the most effective channels for selling these products. However, telemarketing campaigns involve significant costs due to the scale of operations required. Therefore, it is crucial to target the right clients who are most likely to subscribe. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict subscription likelihood based on client and call data.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of two files:
1. **train.csv**: Contains client and telemarketing campaign data along with the target variable (`subscribed`), indicating whether a client subscribed to a term deposit.
2. **test.csv**: Contains similar data for prediction purposes.

### Features:
- **Client information:** Age, job type, marital status, education, etc.
- **Call details:** Duration, day, month, and type of contact.
- **Campaign details:** Number of contacts during and before the campaign, time since last contact, and outcome of previous campaigns.
- **Target variable:** `subscribed` (binary: 1 for subscribed, 0 for not subscribed).

## Key Features and Implementation
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Understanding data distribution.
   - Handling missing values and outliers.
   - Visualizing relationships between features and the target variable.
2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Normalizing numerical features.
3. **Model Training:**
   - Training machine learning models using the provided training dataset.
   - Algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
4. **Evaluation:**
   - The primary metric for evaluation is **accuracy**.
   - Predictions are tested using the `solution_checker.xlsx` tool for validation.
5. **Benchmark Solution:**
   - A baseline Python notebook is provided to guide the implementation and evaluation process.
